print "We want ... a shrubbery!"

## This task is pretty simple for learners to complete. However, what you need to know is that
## there is an important difference between python 2 and python 3 about "print".
## In the online course, we submit our assignments via CodeSkulptor, which execute python 2.
## If you use python 3 on your own computer, you should write code like this:

print("We want ... a shrubbery!")
